            <summary>Windows 7 Lite</summary>
            <p>
              The installation speed was better than Windows 7. Most of the
              installation was Unattended. The Version only consisted of Windows
              7 'Ultimate' with x64 processor. It took 5.10 GB Memory in C
              Drive. So Minimum 10-15 GB should be allocated to C Drive at the
              time of partition. The load on the Host Machine is less than the
              Windows 7 Guest Machine. It took approx 2.9 GB of the Host Machine
              when it was in use. After Installation of VmWare Tools (Driver
              Softwares) it was running more smoothly. It took 6.09GB Memory in
              C Drive while the load on the Host Machine reduced by 0.1GB. Note
              that at the time of installtion of VmWare Tools, it was asking
              permissions after installation of each and every driver.
